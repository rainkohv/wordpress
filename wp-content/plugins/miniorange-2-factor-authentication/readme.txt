== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I gain access to my website if I get locked out? =

You can obtain access to your website by one of the below options:

1. If you have an additional administrator account whose Two Factor is not enabled yet, you can login with it.
2. If you had setup KBA questions earlier, you can use them as an alternate method to login to your website.
3. Rename the plugin from FTP - this disables the Two-Factor (2FA) plugin and you will be able to login with your Wordpress username and password.
